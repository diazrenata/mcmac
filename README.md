macroecological characteristics of manipulated animal communities

using the MACDB and size estimates for species from the literature, which macroecological characteristics of animal communities are resilient to manipulations and which change following manipulation?

quantities considered: total E, total biomass. number of modes in ISD, position of modes in ISD. Past work with this database has addressed individuals-abundance patterns (species richness, shape of SAD). 

break down according to whether the manipulation explicitly targets size or not.
